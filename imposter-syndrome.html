            I figured out a way to work around the times when I'm suffering
            from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>.
            First, I accept any negative thoughts I have about myself as being
            true. Then, I get to work on whatever task or goal I was blocked on
            anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            I usually kick things off by asking, "How could [negative thought]
            finish [blocked task], or achieve [blocked goal]?" For example, if
            I were feeling bad at design, and that was keeping me from building
            a website, I would say to myself, "How could someone who's bad at
            design build a nice website?"
          </p>

          <p>
            That question changes my focus from my own deficiencies to getting
            results. As long as I notice I'm having a problem, and I remember
            to use this trick, it almost always solves the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't have to look like the genius who figured it all out, and I
            don't have to feel bad when I don't. My identity isn't tied to how
            amazing I am. Instead it's tied to putting in the effort. I can do
            that. I know I can keep trying. That only requires that I keep
            showing up. No skill or talent is necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            It takes the pressure off of having to be perfect. I can fail,
            because "I'm just throwing mud against the wall until something
            sticks." It makes it easy to trust in myself, and know that I'll
            figure something out, especially if I keep my current task or goal
            simple. Then, I can just iterate to accomplish something big.
