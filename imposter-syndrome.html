            I figured out a way to work around the times when I'm suffering
            from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>.
            First, I accept any of the bad thoughts I have about myself as being
            true. Then, importantly, I get started anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way I like to get started is to ask, "How could someone who's
            [bad thought] do [task] or achieve [goal]?" That question changes my
            focus from perceived deficiencies to action. For example, if I were
            feeling bad at visual design, and that was keeping me from building
            a website, I would say to myself, "How could someone who's bad at
            visual design build a website?"
          </p>

          <p>
            As long as I actually notice I'm suffering from imposter syndrome,
            and I remember to use this trick, it almost always makes things
            better. The negative energy just drains right out.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think the reason is that I don't have to look like the genius who
            figured it all out, and I don't have to feel bad when I don't. My
            identity isn't tied to who I am. Instead, it's tied to what I'm
            doing. That only requires that I keep showing up. No skill or talent
            are necessary. If I keep making an effort, eventually something good
            will happen.
