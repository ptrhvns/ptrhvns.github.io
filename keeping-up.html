          <p>
            It can be hard to keep up with the pace of change in technology.
            It's especially hard for web developers like me since there are so
            many related technologies, and they change so quickly, but I think
            I've found a straight forward solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key is for me to focus on learning things which are instrumental
            to achieving my goals rather than to chase after what other people
            are doing. If I do the later, then I'm really just working on their
            goals in addition to my own, and that's overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, I try to not to worry about the things I find in
            press releases, news articles, blogs entries, newsletters, link
            aggregators, etc. unless they're directly related to one of my
            goals. I still follow those sources of information just to stay in
            touch, but I don't use them as a to-do list.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since I can eliminate other people's goals, that really only leaves
            me with two reasons to learn about a technology: to have fun, or to
            help me earn an income.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to having fun, I don't feel the need to put pressure
            on myself. Obviously, I can do what I want, when I want. Since
            there's no target to hit, I feel like I can eliminate fun as a
            reason for me to try and keep up with something, and that means
            there's only one reason left.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to earning an income, the best signal I've found for
            what to study is job ads. Of course, if I worked for myself, job ads
            might not be as useful, but that's not the case right now. The nice
            thing about job ads is that they concretely tell me what's valuable
            to employers and what's not, and I can tailor job searches to my
            specific needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            To identify in-demand skills in job ads, and therefore what I should
            study, I follow these basic steps:

            <ol>
              <li>
                Pick a minimal set of programming languages (see below).
              </li>
              <li>
                Search for jobs ads which mention those programming languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Track the skills mentioned in the search results.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sort the tracked skills by how often they're mentioned.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are the criteria I currently use for picking a programming
            language:

            <ol>
              <li>Mainstream</li>
              <li>General purpose</li>
              <li>Good for web development</li>
              <li>Minimal foot guns</li>
              <li>Minimal sharecropping</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            There are lots of ways to figure out which languages are mainstream,
            but at the moment, I use the
            <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>. It's
            not perfect, but I think it's good enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've come across other language rankings, and each one has it's own
            problems, but they all seem to mention, more or less, the same set
            of languages. So, for the sake of simplicity, I just use TIOBE, and
            try to stick to languages in the top 20 without worrying too much
            about each language's relative rank.
          </p>

          <p>
            By minimizing
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharecropping">sharecropping</a>,
            I mean that I try to avoid languages which are controlled by
            corporations (especially predatory ones). I prefer not to leave my
            future in the hands of others, and sharecroppers usually don't fair
            too well in the long run. It's not always possible to avoid
            languages in this category, but I do the best I can. That usually
            means I pick languages which are open source and/or maintained by a
            non-profit group of some kind.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps the most subjective criteria I use is to minimize
            <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=footgun">foot guns</a>.
            I try to avoid programming languages which seem to have been poorly
            designed, or which make it unnecessarily hard to avoid problems.
            Working in those languages is miserable, and they tend to fall out
            of favor. Unfortunately, it's also not always possible to avoid
            languages in this category either.
          </p>

          <p>
            This process has eliminated a lot of work for me. Even so, there's
            still a lot left to learn, but at least now I feel like I have a
            fighting chance.
