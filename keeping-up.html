          <p>
            It can be hard to keep up with the pace of change in technology.
            It's especially hard for web developers like me since there's so
            many related technologies, and they change so quickly, but I think
            I've found a straight forward solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key is to focus on learning things which are instrumental to
            achieving my goals rather than following other people. If I do the
            later, then I'm really just working on their goals on top of my own,
            and it's overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, I don't worry about the things I find in articles,
            blog entries, essays, newsletters, link aggregators, etc. unless
            they're directly relate to one of my goals. Even then, I'm very
            careful. I still follow those sources of information just to stay in
            touch, but I don't use them as a to-do list.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I eliminated other people's goals, I realized I only had two of
            my own possible goals left: having fun, and earning an income.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to having fun, I don't feel the need to put pressure
            on myself. I do what I want, when I want. Since there's no target to
            hit, I was able to eliminate it as a "real" goal, and that only
            leaves one.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to earning an income, the best signal I've found for
            what to study is job ads (since I'm not currently working for
            myself). Ads concretely tell me what's valuable, and what's not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the basic process I follow:

            <ol>
              <li>
                Pick a minimal set of programming languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Search for jobs which list those programming languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Over time, track the skills listed in matching ads.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learn those skills, in order, sorted by how often they're
                mentioned.
              </li>
              <li>
                Limit my study time, but do it consistently.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are my current criteria for picking a programming language:

            <ol>
              <li>Mainstream</li>
              <li>General purpose</li>
              <li>Good for web development</li>
              <li>Minimize foot guns</li>
              <li>Minimize sharecropping</li>
            </ol>

          </p>

          <p>
            There are lots of ways to figure out which languages are mainstream.
            At the moment, though, I use the
            <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>. It's
            not perfect, but it's good enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are a variety of language rankings out there, and they all
            seem to contain the same set of languages, more or less. So, for the
            sake of simplicity, I just use TIOBE, and I don't worry too much
            about the rankings. Instead, I just try to make sure that the set of
            languages I pick from is near the top of the list.
          </p>

          <p>
            By minimizing
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharecropping">sharecropping</a>,
            I mean trying to avoid languages which are controlled by
            corporations (especially predatory ones). I prefer not to leave my
            future in the hands of others, and sharecroppers usually don't fair
            too well. It's not always possible to avoid languages in this
            category, but I do the best I can. That usually means I pick
            languages which are open source and/or maintained by a non-profit
            organization of some kind.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps the most subjective criteria I use is to minimize
            <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=footgun">foot guns</a>.
            I avoid programming languages which seem to have been poorly
            designed, or which make it unnecessarily hard to avoid problems.
            Working in those languages is miserable, and they tend to fall out
            of favor.
          </p>

          <p>
            This process has eliminated a lot of work for me. Even so, there's
            still a lot left to learn, and I have to stay on top of it, but at
            least now I feel like I have a fighting chance.
