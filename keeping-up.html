          <p>
            It can be hard to keep up with changes in technology. It's
            especially hard for web developers like me since there are so many
            technologies involved, and they change so quickly. I'm definitely
            not alone. I read and hear the same complaint from many others, but
            I think I've found a straight forward solution for myself:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Pick a minimal set of programming languages to focus on which
              match the criteria I'll list later.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pick a popular job site, and search for jobs which mention those
              programming languages and the kind of programming I want to do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Track those skills over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focus on learning those skills. Start with the ones most
              frequently mentioned first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit study time to something reasonable, but do it consistently.
            </li>
          </ol>
